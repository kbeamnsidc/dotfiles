Dotfiles
========

This project contains important shell dotfiles, environment variables,
aliases, git, emacs, neovim, and tmux config, that I want to keep
across machines. It uses [GNU
Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage these files.

## Prerequisites

* GNU Make
* GNU Stow

## Installing

```
$ make
